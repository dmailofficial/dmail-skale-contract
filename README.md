# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

npx hardhat verify --contract contracts/Airdrop.sol:DmailAirdrop  --network bsc 0x26f5f3B28ecbbBFe64167Df7c7A3590F90C90Af9 "0xcC6f1e1B87cfCbe9221808d2d85C501aab0B5192" "0x935918103688d46a859508230097b172022Daf4E"
